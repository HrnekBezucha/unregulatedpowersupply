Right, the boards are delivered and after quick inspection they look fine. The silkscreen is a bit offset again bit it doesn't look as rough.

That means I'll make a build stream if I manage to get a camera to work. Only then I can really see whether it works. I did this once before on a perfboard with through-hole components in two layers making it look like a sloppy climbing frame for 1/8" kids. Don't ask me how did I get it accredited as a safe playground equipment when it's not safely embedded in the ground and the construction is joined with lead-based solder.

Getting the thing on a pre-wired PCB makes everything so much easier. Just put the little thingies for the pixies to dance in and let the party begin.
