# Jekyll does my head in

Sure it's a great tool. No question. But for a non-programmer
it's a bit of something to grasp what am I supposed to do
with all that functionality.

I can see all the good stuff, that can be done with it, though.
Soon I'll start porting all the content from wordpress to local jekyll
and on github. For now using the default template layout thing and
when there's more content it'll be more interesting to see the changes.
