There we go, it's all here. Now to re-learn css/sass to get it looking reasonably well. I know I could just get some default template and roll with it but I'm not known for taking the easy way route.

On the other hand, the Diode Matrix ROM board is ready to get some love. It looks and works well and good and some people on Tindie may be interested. Even though it hardly _solves a problem._ Not everything needs a purpose, right? Meaning is arbitrary and this really doesn't need to go existential.

Be seeing you
