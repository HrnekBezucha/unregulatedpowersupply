In the past weeks I didn't do much of electronics endeavours. What I did do, though is stop using my smartphone. It's a good machine, don't get me wrong. Huawei P8, nice and solid. There are metric tons of reasons people would do this thing and I'll leave the arguing to them. All I say is that it's totally worth it, unless you _absolutely_ need it for your work or something. I know that a good job wouldn't really make me happy so I don't persue it.

I wanted peace and that's what I got. 

The phone sits on my desk without a sign of life and the only thing I may need it is skype with my distant family. But only till I set it up on the laptop.

Yes, the title is a bit misleading but aren't we getting used to it at this point? I bought another laptop to replace the original. It's a decade old Thinkpad x200. Yes, I have an ancient thinkpad and run linux, call me _that guy_ and watch my beard growing. But I'll post about the thinkpad later. Once I'm more gotten used to it.

Changing both of my beloved distracion devices completely changed my routine. Which is what I was hoping for. Making a big enough shift, that the habits will be broken and lying in the curb. And I didn't have to do that much. Now only maintaining awareness over how I spend my time on the new devices and it'll all be good and dandy. It's not over yet.

For a long now I'm not on facebook, either.

And it's like the shackles were broken and I have time to do whatever I want. You know, _Freedom (terms and conditions apply)._ So I started with the dinkie things like going through old clothes and stuff to bin or donate; learning bash and \*nix core utilities; getting more comfortable in terminal, using more text-based applications instead of clicking here and there, even though the thinkpad nipple (trademark) kicks ass, just using keyboard really makes things faster and cooler.
