title: 4-bit full adder - because CMOS is awesome

What is this? A new project?

Yes, the diode ROM with LED display is considered finished. It works fine, new through hole boards are on the way and I'm expecting everything to go swimmingly.

With that done, the limit of two open projects allows another and that is - adding two 4-bit binary numbers with CMOS logic gates.

All 4000 logic here.

If you've watched any of the Ben Eater's videos on building an 8 bit computer on a breadboard, this will be familiar. But I don't really care to make a whole computer, just having fun with logic. And Ben is working with 74LSxx chips. Doing this because understanding the logic architecture of a computer or just a CPU, week give you a bit of appreciation for the miracle you're just reading this on.

Anyway, another thing you may notice on the picture is a website on the labels. I like to support smaller distributors of components in the local area. Bitsbox is not exactly local, strictly speaking but is just a couple of miles away.

Getting the working adder is just a little part of the journey. Well, it's the end. But the end isn't the point. The point is to understand how and why it works. That's the fun part. I strongly believe in learning by understanding, rather than knowledge. Context and structure. But I'll leave the "Everything that's wrong with X" (in this case education) rant to others.

I might do a Github repository just for fun because this project is old-school af otherwise. Green and yellow LEDs, CMOS logic, dip switches and perfboard. Everything hobbyist-friendly.

Stay tuned.
