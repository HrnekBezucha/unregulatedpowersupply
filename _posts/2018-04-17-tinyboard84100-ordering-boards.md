Now even tinier!

Status update: the TinyBoard84100 is ready and sent off to the board-house for summoning from it's digital realm.

Looking at the title picture you can tell that a bit was chopped off, the bit with the two pin connection. It was taking too much space and was unnecessary because the MCU's power pins handle power as well. No redundancy, thank you very much.

All the progress is on my <a href="/TinyBoard84100">Github project site</a>, you can track it there or make changes or whatever you like.

Regarding the board house: first time I stated back in the day PCBway was suggested as the cheapest option and I kinda stuck to it. The boards generally move from $15 delivered upwards. Some board houses offer different price per board but then get the price difference on shipping. So it always goes just about the same. The thing to keep in mind is that they won't tell you the limit of what you can get for what. For example, your boards will only get more expensive when you exceed a certain limit. But they won't tell you what the limit is. Same applies to quantities and other things. So get your quote and slowly nudge the parameters bit by bit until the price jumps to the next limit.

At first I wanted to get twenty-five boards made but with parameters I set I found out that I can get fifty for the same price. So that's what I got.

Another thing to note is that it's cheaper to get your boards as a panel (or panels) rather than individuals. Like a lot. After spending hours finding out how to panelise the boards in KiCAD, found out PCBway has an option to panelise the design for you. And that is also cheaper than doing it yourself, which is interesting. Guess there were too many mess-ups to take care of.

That's done now and the project is put on-hold for the 15-30 days delivery will take. I can get the programmer ready, Arduino IDE and Tindie listing draft.

Everything should go swimmingly.
