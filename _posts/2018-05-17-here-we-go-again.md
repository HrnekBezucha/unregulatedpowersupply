So I fixed the footprints, redid the layout and ordered the boards again.

Yes, I'm spending quite some money on this project. But I'm just too stubborn to stop until it's done.

One board has been fully assembled so then I need to figure out how to burn some bootloader onto it and that will be it.

That's a bloody short post. Use the spare time wisely.

Or go read the other post I just made, winky, winky.
