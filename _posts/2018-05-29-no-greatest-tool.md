> One night there was a storm, and Master Wq’s house collapsed. The next morning he began to build it again using his old tools. His novice came to help him, and they built for a while and were making good progress. As they worked, the novice began to tell Master Wq of his latest accomplishments.
<br/><br/>“Master, I have developed a wonderful Vim script to give all sorts of useful information about a document. It counts the words, the sentences, the paragraphs, and even tells you what kind of document it is using the syntax highlighting rules. I use it in my pipelines all the time. It is a thing of beauty, and I am very proud. Truly, Vim is the greatest tool!”
<br/><br/>Master Wq did not reply. Thinking he had unwittingly angered his master, the novice fell silent and continued his work.
<br/><br/>The novice finished aligning two beams and had positioned a nail ready for beating into the wood, but found the hammer was out of reach.
<br/><br/>“Would you pass me the hammer, master?”
<br/><br/>Master Wq handed the novice a saw.
<br/><br/>At once, the novice was enlightened.

This is just about the most beautiful Vim koan I've read. 

What tools you use really doesn't matter nearly as much as how skillfully you can use them. It can be really anything. From musical instruments to software tools. I am a Vim user. Does that matter? No. It's just the tool I know. So whenever I mention a name of a piece of software, feel free to replace it with anything relevant to you.

Ever since the begginingless of time people were arguing whether Vim or Emacs is the best tool to use. They're each very different in many ways but in many ways they are very similar. If you can skilfully use one of them, use it. Adjust it to your liking but don't switch. Many people I've talked to learnt an alternative - emacs instead of vim, vim instead of emacs, qwerty and dvorak, eagle or kicad. Ultimately, most of them said it was nothing but a waste of time. Granted, there are legitimate reasons to switch. But if the only reason is something vague like _efficiency_ or _productivity_ than the answer is - don't.

Many will argue for one or the other because they they paid a great price for them. Not literally, they're free and open. People pay with time and endeavour to learn such tools.

Driving a car and changing directions every few kilometers just because there may be a slightly better way to get there will only get you lost.

Get a tool, which does the thing you need to achieve and master it.

Good reason to switch is when the tools you already know can't do what you're after. Or when the _TOS_ aren't favourable anymore.

Are you using nano? That's fine. If it does what you need, great. MSpaint for board layout? If it does the job without a problem, great.

There aren't many manufacturers who would accept a board layout.bmp, though. Doing boards at home is different. When working with other people, directly or indirectly, you need to adjust your workflow. That is a good reason to learn another tool.

With increasing skill your demands and expectations of your tools will change. Suddenly, tools that were good enough won't cut it anymore. That is a good reason to switch.
