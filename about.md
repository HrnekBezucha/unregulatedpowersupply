`The site is still under development, be patient`

My name is Matej Lajcik (don't worry about pronunciation). Currently living in Greter Manchester, England. Hobby electronics is my thing, and so is everything around computers. Been using Linux for almost a decade. Wouldn't label myself as a programmer but have a look at my [Github repositories](https://github.com/UnregulatedPowersupply?tab=repositories) and judge. 

The site is generously hosted by Github with the help of Jekyll. But the theme is custom, that's why it looks like a school project from early 2000s.
All images used on this site are hosted on [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/TPBpv1s)
